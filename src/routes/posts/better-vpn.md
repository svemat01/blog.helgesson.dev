First of all, I am not sponsored or endorsed by Tailscale (hit me up tho Tailscale ðŸ˜œ). However it is really awesome and I plan to make you feel the same today.

Unlike most other vpns, Tailscale is not used to access the global internet *(or atleast usually, more on that later)*. Instead it is used to create your own mesh network like your own little LAN but globally accessible. If you have ever used LogMeIn Hamachi to play games or the like with your friends, you will probably know what I'm talking about.

The cool thing about Tailscale is that it uses wireguard in the background so we get the same amazing speeds and latency as with a normal wireguard vpn. However what's different here is that Tailscale orchestrates the connection between all of Tailscale devices by routing the connections thru their servers *(encrypted of course)* and distributing the encrypting keys.

## Installing Tailscale

Let's get started by installing tailscale on your computer. Since installation instructions can sometimes change I recommend you to instead visit [their download page](https://tailscale.com/download/). They have a handy installation script at the page I linked to but if you are on linux, your package manager might already have tailscale added, but your result may vary.
