Having recently received my new X1 Carbon 10th gen, I thought I'd share some of the things I've done to get it up and running.
I'm running Arch Linux on it, and I've been using it for a few days now. I've also been using it for work, so I've been able to test it out a bit.

## Hardware

My machine is the X1 Carbon 10th gen, with the following specs:

* Intel Core i7-1260p
* 32GB RAM
* 1TB NVMe SSD
* 14" 1920x1200 IPS display

## Installation

While some may dislike the newish `archinstall` command, I've found it to be a great way to get a system up and running.
The common criticism I've heard is that it takes away the fun or novelty of installing Arch.
However I think that we shouldn't be gatekeeping the installation process, and that it's great to have a tool that makes it easier for new users to get started.
